One of\n        the most important things that I have learned is the importance of having a strong online presence. A\n        well-designed portfolio website can be a powerful tool for attracting potential clients and showcasing your\n        abilities. In this essay, I will discuss the importance of having a strong online presence, as well as some of\n        the key features and technologies that I used to build my portfolio website. A strong online presence is\n        essential for any developer who wants to be successful. It provides a platform for showcasing your skills and\n        experience, as well as attracting potential clients and collaborators. Without a strong online presence, it can\n        be difficult to get noticed and stand out from the crowd. When building my portfolio website, I decided to use\n        Next.js, a popular React framework. Next.js provides a powerful set of tools and features that make it easy to\n        build fast, scalable, and secure websites. Some of the key features of Next.js include server-side rendering,\n        static site generation, and built-in support for internationalization and accessibility. In addition to Next.js,\n        I also used a number of other technologies and tools to build my portfolio website. These include Tailwind CSS,\n        a popular CSS framework, and TypeScript, a statically typed programming language. Tailwind CSS provides a\n        powerful set of pre-defined classes and utilities that make it easy to quickly and easily style your website.\n        TypeScript, on the other hand, provides a number of benefits, including improved code quality and\n        maintainability, as well as better performance and scalability. Overall, I am very pleased with how my portfolio\n        website has turned out. I believe that it effectively showcases my skills and experience, and I am excited to\n        continue improving and adding to it in the future.{\" \"}\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n"],"names":[],"mappings":";;;;;;;AAIe,SAAS,WAAW,EAAE,QAAQ,EAAiC;IAC5E,qBACE,8OAAC;;0BACC,8OAAC;0BAAG;;;;;;0BACJ,8OAAC;gBAAE,WAAU;;oBAAc;oBAkB0B;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAI3D"}}]
